The Perceptrons are generally based on different types of artificial neurons known as **Threshold Logic Unit (TLU) or sometimes Linear Threshold Unit (LTU).** The inputs and outputs of a perceptron are numbers, unlike the values we see using a classification algorithm like logistic regression (True or False values).\n",

        "Perceptrons are made up of a single layer of Threshold Logic Unit where each TLU is connected to all inputs. A single TLU can be used to solve the binary classification problem and if all neurons in one layer are connected to each neuron in the previous layer, it is called a fully connected layer or dense layer. Such types of architectures can be used in the problems of multiclass classification.\n"
