We manually specified the color to be 'RdBu', as the Republican party has been traditionally associated with red, and the Democratic party with blue.\n",

This is the kind of information that our machine learning model will seek to learn when we try to predict party affiliation solely based on voting behavior. An expert in U.S politics may be able to predict this without machine learning, but probably not instantaneously - and certainly not if we are dealing with hundreds of samples!\n",

Be sure to begin your plotting statements for each figure with plt.figure() so that a new figure will be set up. Otherwise, your plots will be overlayed onto the same figure"
