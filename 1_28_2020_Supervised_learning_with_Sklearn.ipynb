For example, your computer can learn to predict whether an email is spam or not spam given its content and sender. Another example: your computer can learn to cluster, say, Wikipedia entries, into different categories based on the words they contain. It could then assign any new Wikipedia article to one of the existing clusters. Notice that, in the first example, we are trying to predict a particular class label, that is, spam or not spam. In the second example, there is no such label. When there are labels present, we call it supervised learning. When there are no labels present, we call it unsupervised learning.\n",

For example, a business may wish to group its customers into distinct categories based on their purchasing behavior without knowing in advance what these categories maybe. This is known as clustering, one branch of unsupervised learning.\n",

Reinforcement agents are able to automatically figure out how to optimize their behavior given a system of rewards and punishments. Reinforcement learning draws inspiration from behavioral psychology and has applications in many fields, such as, economics, genetics, as well as game playing. In 2016, reinforcement learning was used to train Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, which was the first computer program to beat the world champion in Go.\n",

        "But let's come back to supervised learning, which will be the focus of this course. In supervised learning, we have several data points or samples, described using predictor variables or features and a target variable. Our data is commonly represented in a table structure such as the one you see here, in which there is a row for each data point and a column for each feature. Here, we see the iris dataset: each row represents measurements of a different flower and each column is a particular kind of measurement, like the width and length of a certain part of the flower. The aim of supervised learning is to build a model that is able to predict the target variable, here the particular species of a flower, given the predictor variables, here the physical measurements. If the target variable consists of categories, like 'click' or 'no click', 'spam' or 'not spam', or different species of flowers, we call the learning task classification. Alternatively, if the target is a continuously varying variable, for example, the price of a house, it is a regression task. In this chapter, we will focus on classification. In the following, on regression.\n",

We then instantiate our KNeighborsClassifier, set the number of neighbors equal to 6, and assign it to the variable knn. Then we can fit this classifier to our training set, the labeled data. To do so, we apply the method fit to the classifier and pass it two arguments: the features as a NumPy array and the labels, or target, as a NumPy array. The scikit-learn API requires firstly that you have the data as a NumPy array or pandas DataFrame. It also requires that the features take on continuous values, such as the price of a house, as opposed to categories, such as 'male' or 'female'. It also requires that there are no missing values in the data. All datasets that we'll work with now satisfy these final two properties. Later in the course, you'll see how to deal with categorical features and missing data. In particular, the scikit-learn API requires that the features are in an array where each column is a feature and each row a different observation or data point. Looking at the shape of iris data, we see that there are 150 observations of four features. Similarly, the target needs to be a single column with the same number of observations as the feature data. We see in this case there are indeed also 150 labels. Also check out what is returned when we fit the classifier: it returns the classifier itself and modifies it to fit it to the data. Now that we have fit our classifier, lets use it to predict on some unlabeled data!"

The first argument will be the feature data, the second the targets or labels. The test size keyword argument specifies what proportion of the original data is used for the test set. Lastly, the random state kwarg sets a seed for the random number generator that splits the data into train and test. Setting the seed with the same argument later will allow you to reproduce the exact split and your downstream results. train test split returns four arrays: the training data, the test data, the training labels, and the test labels. We unpack these into four variables: X train, X test, y train, and y test, respectively. By default, train test split splits the data into 75% training data and 25% test data, which is a good rule of thumb. We specify the size of the test size using the keyword argument test size, which we do here to set it to 30%. It is also best practice to perform your split so that the split reflects the the labels on your data. That is, you want the labels to be distributed in train and test sets as they are in the original dataset. To achieve this, we use the keyword argument stratify equals y, where y the list or array containing the labels. We then instantiate our K-nearest neighbors classifier, fit it to the training data using the fit method, make our predictions on the test data and store the results as y pred. Printing them shows that the predictions take on three values, as expected. To check out the accuracy of our model, we use the score method of the model and pass it X test and y test. See here that the accuracy of our K-nearest neighbors model is approximately 95%, which is pretty good for an out-of-the-box model!\n",

Hugo, however, got to perform multi-class classification in the videos, where the target variable could take on three possible outcomes. Why does he get to have all the fun?! In the following exercises, you'll be working with the [MNIST digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9! A reduced version of the MNIST dataset is one of scikit-learn's included datasets, and that is the one we will use in this exercise.\n",

Recall that scikit-learn's built-in datasets are of type Bunch, which are dictionary-like objects. Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an 'images' key in addition to the 'data' and 'target' keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this 'images' key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see Chapter 2 of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python). On the other hand, the 'data' key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.\n",

For this reason, it is common practice to alter the loss function so that it penalizes for large coefficients. This is called regularization.

Thus, when minimizing the loss function to fit to our data, models are penalized for coefficients with a large magnitude: large positive and large negative coefficients, that is. Note that alpha is a parameter we need to choose in order to fit and predict. Essentially, we can select the alpha for which our model performs best. Picking alpha for ridge regression is similar to picking k in KNN. This is called hyperparameter tuning and we'll see much more of this soon. This alpha, which you may also see called lambda in the wild, can be thought of as a parameter that controls model complexity. Notice that when alpha is equal to zero, we get back OLS. Large coefficients in this case are not penalized and the overfitting problem is not accounted for. A very high alpha means that large coefficients are significantly penalized, which can lead to a model that is too simple and ends up underfitting the data. The method of performing ridge regression with scikit-learn mirrors the other models that we have seen."

However, this naive classifier does a horrible job of predicting spam: it never predicts spam at all, so it completely fails at its original purpose. The situation when one class is more frequent is called class imbalance because the class of real emails contains way more instances than the class of spam.

Such parameters, ones that need to be specified before fitting a model, are called hyperparameters. In other words, these are parameters that cannot be explicitly learned by fitting the model.

This is called hyperparameter tuning and doing so in this fashion is the current standard. There may be a better way, however, and if you figure it out, I'd be surprised if it wouldn't make you famous. Now, when fitting different values of a hyperparameter, it is essential to use cross-validation as using train test split alone would risk overfitting the hyperparameter to the test set. We'll see in the next video that, even after tuning our hyperparameters using cross-validation, we'll want to have already split off a test set in order to report how well our model can be expected to perform on a dataset that it has never seen before.\n",

The values in the grid dictionary are lists containing the values we wish to tune the relevant hyperparameter or hyperparameters over. If we specify multiple parameters, all possible combinations will be tried. As always, we instantiate our classifier. We then use GridSearchCV and pass it our model, the grid we wish to tune over and the number of folds that we wish to use. This returns a GridSearch object that you can then fit to the data and this fit performs the actual grid search inplace.

However, all the data that you have used so far has been relatively nice and in a format that allows you to plug and play into scikit-learn from the get-go. With real-world data, this will rarely be the case, and instead you will have to preprocess your data before you can build models.

We've lost half of our data and this is unacceptable. If only a few rows contain missing values, then it's not so bad, but generally we need a more robust method. It is generally an equally bad idea to remove columns that contain NaNs.\n",

        "Another option is to impute missing data. All imputing means is to make an educated guess as to what the missing values could be. A common strategy is, in any given column with missing values, to compute the mean of all the non-missing entries and to replace all missing values with the mean. Let's try this now on our dataset. We import Imputer from sklearn dot preprocessing and instantiate an instance of the Imputer: imp. The keyword argument missing values here specifies that missing values are represented by NaN; strategy specifies that we will use the mean as described above; axis equals 0 specifies that we will impute along columns, a '1' would mean rows. Now, we can fit this imputer to our data using the fit method and then transform our data using the transform method! Due to their ability to transform our data as such, imputers are known as transformers, and any model that can transform data this way, using the transform method, is called a transformer. After transforming the data, we could then fit our supervised learning model to it, but is there a way to do both at once?\n",

We then build the Pipeline object! We construct a list of steps in the pipeline, where each step is a 2-tuple containing the name you wish to give the relevant step and the estimator. We then pass this list to the Pipeline constructor. We can split our data into training and test sets and\n",
