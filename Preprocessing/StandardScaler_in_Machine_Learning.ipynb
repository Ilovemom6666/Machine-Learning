        "\n",
        "StandardScaler removes the mean and scales the data to the unit variance. However, outliers have an influence when calculating the empirical mean and standard deviation, which narrows the range of characteristic values.\n",
        "\n",
        "These differences in the initial features can cause problems for many machine learning models. For example, for models based on the calculation of distance, if one of the features has a wide range of values, the distance will be governed by that particular characteristic.\n",
        "\n",

        "So, to deal with this potential problem, we need to standardize the data (μ = 0, σ = 1) that is typically used before we integrate it into the machine learning model."
